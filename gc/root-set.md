A general reference on ["what kind of references are in root sets"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6366211/what-are-the-roots).

The reason I refered to these references as root sets instead of root set is that there are more than one set of these references, and a reference can be of more than one type. In HotSpot JVM, there are the following types of root sets.

- universe
- jni_handles
- object_synchronizer
- flat_profiler
- managment
- system_dictionary
- class_loader_data
- jvmti
- code_cache
- thread_roots
